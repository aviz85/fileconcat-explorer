# FileConcat Explorer: Project Description

FileConcat Explorer is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of browsing, selecting, and concatenating files based on user-defined patterns. This document provides an in-depth overview of the project's architecture, features, and functionality.

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Backend (Server)**
   - Built with Node.js and Express.js
   - Handles file system operations and concatenation logic
   - Provides RESTful API endpoints for the frontend

2. **Frontend (Client)**
   - Built with React
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for file browsing and selection
   - Communicates with the backend via HTTP requests

## Key Components

### Backend

1. **Server (server.js)**
   - Sets up the Express server and middleware
   - Defines API routes

2. **File Routes (routes/files.js)**
   - Handles requests for file browsing and default list retrieval

3. **Concatenate Route (routes/concatenate.js)**
   - Processes file concatenation requests

4. **File Utilities (utils/fileUtils.js)**
   - Contains core logic for file operations and concatenation

### Frontend

1. **Main App (App.js)**
   - Manages application state
   - Renders main components

2. **FileBrowser Component**
   - Allows users to navigate the file system

3. **FileList Component**
   - Displays files and folders
   - Handles drag-and-drop functionality

4. **Whitelist Component**
   - Displays and manages the whitelist of files/patterns to include

5. **Blacklist Component**
   - Displays and manages the blacklist of files/patterns to exclude

6. **Stats Component**
   - Displays statistics about the concatenated files

## Key Features

1. **File System Browser**
   - Users can navigate their file system directly in the web interface
   - "Up" button allows easy navigation to parent directories

2. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**
   - Files and folders can be dragged from the file browser to the whitelist

3. **Whitelist and Blacklist**
   - Users can specify patterns for inclusion (whitelist) and exclusion (blacklist)
   - Support for wildcards and complex patterns (e.g., `**/*.js` for all JavaScript files in any subdirectory)

4. **Default Lists**
   - Application loads default whitelist and blacklist patterns from server-side text files

5. **File Concatenation**
   - Server processes files based on whitelist and blacklist patterns
   - Concatenates content of matching files

6. **Statistics**
   - Provides statistics on the concatenated output (total lines, words, and characters)

## Workflow

1. User navigates the file system using the FileBrowser component
2. Files/folders are added to the whitelist via drag-and-drop or manual entry
3. User can modify the whitelist and blacklist as needed
4. Upon clicking "Concatenate Files", the frontend sends a request to the backend
5. Backend processes the request, concatenates files, and returns statistics
6. Frontend displays the result and statistics to the user

## Extensibility

The modular design of FileConcat Explorer allows for easy extension and modification:

- New file operations can be added by creating new route handlers and utility functions
- The frontend can be extended with new components or features without major changes to the existing structure
- Support for new file types or pattern matching can be added by modifying the `fileUtils.js` module

This architecture provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and customizations to meet evolving user needs.
